# ANZ Microsoft Unconference Workshops

As part of the ANZ Unconference, Microsoft delivered a set of workshops to inspire designed to spark engineering curiosity, igniting conversation about exciting tech initiatives inside and 
outside of ANZ.  The aim is for people to leave feeling inspired and energised about the possibilities for the future of tech at ANZ.   
Through a series of workshops including an IoT Hack, All you need to know about Machine Learning and AI, Quantum Computing, 
Data Bricks and Going Serverless and the Azure DevOps platform  and a keynote speech by  Sam Brown,
 a commercial attorney in Microsoft Australiaâ€™s Corporate, External and Legal Affairs (CELA) team, 
 on Ethics in Technology and how can we unleash responsible AI to help improve the world,
 we hope to showcase how Microsoft Azure is driving change and inspiring a digital first culture at ANZ.
